# github-watchers

> Get all GitHub watchers and starrers for a repo

This tool will show you all of the GitHub watchers for an organization, as well as the usernames of everyone who has starred your repository. It will present both the deduplicated list of users, and the total counts across all repositories.

## Future Goals

- Histogram of starrers/subscribers over time (possible?)
- Show all the orgs that the watchers/starrers are members of
- Show their businesses, because that's interesting
- Get their emails
- Show the amount of open issues in an org
- Show the amount of open PRs in an org
- Show the average length of open issues/PRs
- Show the oldest date of an open issue/PR
- Show the last interaction
  - The last commit on any branch
  - The last commit on master
  - The last issue closed
  - The last PR merged
